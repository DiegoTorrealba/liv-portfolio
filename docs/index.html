          I'm a third-year journalism major and media entertainment industries
          minor at UT Austin! I am interested in pursuing music journalism and
          creative media as I am particularly interested in music, film, and the
          arts. I am a passionate creative dedicated to capturing the moment and
          uplifting others through accurate and compelling visuals and
          storytelling. My work is a reflection of my belief that there is art
          in everything and that every individual has a story worth telling.

          I am a video reporter for The Daily Texan where I primarily focus on
          filming feature and documentary-style stories to highlight groups,
          events and individuals on campus and throughout Austin. I'm also a
          freelance photographer and have shot for various local artists around
          Austin.

          I joined Bevo Video Productions in the spring semester of my freshman
          year to explore my interest in camera operation and the film industry.
          I found my passion for videography through BVP and have been lucky
          enough to film for Longhorn Athletics, the ITF World Tennis Tour, and
          campus events. This year I've spent my fall and spring semesters as
          the video producer for Longhorn Weekly where I filmed both the Coach
          Sark and Coach Terry shows at Pluckers Wing Bar.

          I've known I was a writer since I was a little girl collecting pretty
          journals to fill with poems, short stories, songs, and everything in
          between. I had a larger imagination than I knew what to do with, which
          has since led me to explore various creative interests and gain skills
          across creative landscapes. The Glaze Zine writing department has
          given me the space to write outside of a journalistic lens and to take
          my writing in a more creative direction.
